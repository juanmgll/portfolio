      <p>
        I am a passionate and self-taught programmer with a strong sense of
        responsibility. From a young age, I was fascinated by the world of
        technology and programming. My journey began with playing video games,
        but soon I found myself wanting to create my own. My first encounter
        with coding was through GML (Game Maker Language), but I eventually
        transitioned to Unity with C#, a technology Iâ€™ve used extensively and
        where I truly excel.
